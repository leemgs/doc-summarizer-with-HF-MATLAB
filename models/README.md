Here are 5 popular models for text summarization, including **google/pegasus-xsum**, along with their features and Hugging Face URLs:

### 1. **google/pegasus-xsum**
   - **Feature**: Specialized for abstractive summarization tasks, particularly on news articles. It is fine-tuned on the XSum dataset, known for generating concise, high-quality summaries.
   - **Hugging Face URL**: [google/pegasus-xsum](https://huggingface.co/google/pegasus-xsum)

### 2. **facebook/bart-large-cnn**
   - **Feature**: A robust model fine-tuned on the CNN/Daily Mail dataset. It excels in producing coherent and well-structured summaries for long text, suitable for both extractive and abstractive summarization.
   - **Hugging Face URL**: [facebook/bart-large-cnn](https://huggingface.co/facebook/bart-large-cnn)

### 3. **t5-base**
   - **Feature**: Part of the T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) family, it is versatile for various NLP tasks, including summarization. T5 can handle a wide range of text-to-text tasks, providing flexibility for summarization and other applications.
   - **Hugging Face URL**: [t5-base](https://huggingface.co/t5-base)

### 4. **sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6**
   - **Feature**: A distilled version of the BART model, this model is smaller and faster while maintaining competitive performance for summarization tasks. It was fine-tuned on the CNN/Daily Mail dataset and offers faster inference.
   - **Hugging Face URL**: [sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6](https://huggingface.co/sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6)

### 5. **google/pegasus-large**
   - **Feature**: An enhanced version of the Pegasus model, fine-tuned on multiple datasets for high-quality abstractive summarization. It generates high-level summaries and is especially effective for long documents.
   - **Hugging Face URL**: [google/pegasus-large](https://huggingface.co/google/pegasus-large)

These models can be easily switched in your summarization tasks by replacing the model name in your code with any of these Hugging Face model URLs.
